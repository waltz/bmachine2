<h2>Help: Users</h2>

<p>There are two types of users in Broadcast Machine:</p>

<p><strong>Admins</strong> can do everything: publish and edit video, create and edit channels, adjust settings, and add or delete users.</p>

<p><strong>Registered Users</strong> are much more limited and can download videos and can optionally post videos.  

<p>To add a user of either type, simply fill out the fields on the user page.  If you check off 'make user admin', the user will be an admin.  You can always edit users' info later on.</p>

<p>Broadcast Machine has a series of user settings that are designed to allow a broader community of people to submit video to your site, if you would like. If you allow users to post files to any of your channels, you can accept videos from visitors and then decide if you would like to publish them to other (potentially more exclusive) channels.</p>
