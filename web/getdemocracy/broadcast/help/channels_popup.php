<h2>Help: Channels</h2>

<p>Users can subscribe to Channels that you create in Broadcast Machine and they will automatically be notified when new you post new videos. Some users will set their video watching software, such as DTV, to download all videos from a channel automatically. Channels are a powerful way of connecting to your audience on an ongoing basis, even if you publish new content only occasionally.
On a technical level, Channels are RSS feeds which contain any available metadata about a file as well as a link (enclosure) to the video file itself.</p>

<h3>Creating a Channel</h3>

<p>To Create a channel, click 'Create a Channel' in the 'Channel' tab and fill in the fields. You can create as many channels as you like and can use channels as a way to organize content you are publishing for specific audiences. For example, if you publish sports video, you might make a channel for football, baseball, and soccer. You could also have an 'everything' channel, that includes every video from each of the specific sports channels.</p>
