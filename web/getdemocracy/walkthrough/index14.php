	<br /> <p> The "New Videos" channel makes Democracy Player into a simple TV-viewing application.
	Whenever a new video is downloaded to your computer, it is added to this list. You can browse and
	manually pick certain videos to watch from the list. Click the video at the top and all new videos will play in order, one after the
	other. When you're done watching your new videos, you can choose to save them by clicking on the
	"Save" button to the right of the video description. If you don't do anything, the videos will
	automatically expire after a set time (6 days by default) freeing up space for fresh videos.  You can always re-download videos that expire.</p>
