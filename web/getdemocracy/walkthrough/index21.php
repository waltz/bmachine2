	<h1>Share Democracy</h1>
	<br /> <p> Telling friends about videos and channels you like is one click in Democracy Player.
	When you click on the envelope button for a given video or channel, Democracy Player opens up a
	compose message in your local mail client with the video and channel link already pasted in. You
	can customize the message, hit send, and your friends can easily see what you've been watching. One
	way to share all the videos you like to watch is to pass your Video Bomb channel around -- you are
	a filter for your friends' media.</p>
