	<p>Once Democracy Player downloads to your computer, install it and start it up.  You will see the channels that come pre-subscribed with the player, and you can subscribe to new channels in the Guide. Hit play on New Videos and any new videos will play one after the other. Democracy Player can be as simple to use as turning on your TV.</p>
