	<h1>Search for Videos</h1>

	<br /> <p> There are three ways to search for videos in Democracy Player. First there's the Channel Guide: you can search for
	channels you like in the Channel guide, just go to the search field and type in a keyword for
	channels you want to watch. To find videos that are available on channels you already have, use the
	search box in the top right of the channel bar to quickly find videos already on your computer or videos that are
	available for downloading.  This is especially handy in My Collection, to search through all your saved videos.  For searching for videos on the web, click on the last main
	item in the Channels sidebar, "Search". Type your search keyword and Democracy Player will display all
	the videos in Yahoo Video's database and show them in the main window on the Democracy Player.</p>
