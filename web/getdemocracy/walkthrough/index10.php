	<br />
	<p>Videos are listed with some helpful information, including file size, publishing date, format
	and a brief description of the video. When you're done watching a video, it will show an expiration
	time; this is how long the video will be stored on your computer before it automatically gets
	deleted to make room for newer material. You can also delete videos right away, by clicking on the
	trash can to the right of the channel description. Archiving videos is just as easy -- the "save" link
	places the video into your "My Collection" channel and will always be on this channel. </p>
