	<p>Auto-downloading makes using Democracy Player really simple. When enabled, the Democracy Player
	will grab new videos from a channel as soon as they're available. You can turn auto-download on for
	any channel by checking the box off at the top of the channel view. As soon as you know you like a
	channel, there is no need to think about it again; let Democracy Player handle the downloading.</p>
