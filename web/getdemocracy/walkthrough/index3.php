	<p> The Channels sidebar is on the left side of Democracy Player and displays all of the channels
	that you are subscribed to. The first four items on the Channels Sidebar are permanent tools to help you: Channel Guide (find channels to subscribe to), My Collection (all the videos you've downloaded), New Videos (videos that you haven't watched or have watched recently), and Search (search the web for videos). The main window of Democracy Player plays videos and also displays the list of videos on each channel when you're not watching videos. </p>
