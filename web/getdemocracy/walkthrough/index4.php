	<h1>Finding New Videos with the Channel Guide</h1>
	<img src="<?=  ?>/images/windows-walk-screens/04.channelguide.png" />
	<br /> <p> The first item in the Channels sidebar is the "Channel Guide", a built-in guide
	for finding channels you want to watch. The Channel Guide is an open listing of channels grouped by
	category, tag, popularity, and date. It's a picture library of video channels available in the
	Democracy Player player (you can also visit the Channel Guide through your web browser). The Guide
	already has more than 300 channels, so click around and explore it. Anyone can publish their channel to the guide; independent videomakers, bloggers, organizations, and companies, will all make the guide more rich and interesting every day.</p>
