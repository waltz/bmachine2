													advocates, including the Participatory Culture Foundation (PCF), which also uses VLC. "Internet TV

													<p>"I've been meaning to

													of hosting video to thousands of potential viewers, a small website owner can serve video
													affordably and, moreover, relatively easily via the Broadcast Machine software interface. It can
													also be used to publish an aggregate channel of found video just as easily, so fans and editors can

													<p><em>Others focus on the prospect of outsiders' gaining access to your TV set, as bloggers have
													invaded media on the Web. "Already there is more data downloaded for video over the Internet than

													a BitTorrent browser that's easy to use and plugs right into your TV? You go from 500 channels to
													50 million channels." We soon may find out, as a number of open-source-inspired Internet efforts
