<h2>Publishing Options</h2>

<p>Peer-to-peer technology let's anyone publish a video channel from a personal computer and basic website with unlimited content and no bandwidth costs, regardless of the size of the audience.</p>

<p>If you are an organization, you may wish to use additional server capacity to provide a permanent home for your content.  You can use your server as a 'seeder' for the file which gives the video file a permanent location that won't expire if users stop sharing the file.  This 'server-side seeding' option is ideal for most organizations.</p>
