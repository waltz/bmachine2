<h2>Installing Broadcast Machine</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="<?= $base ?>/broadcast/bm.zip">Download Broadcast Machine</a> and open 
the zip file.</li>
<li>Copy the folder "bm" to the public_html directory on your website.</li>
<li>Point your browser to www.yourwebsite.com/bm</li>
<li>If you see a login screen, you're ready to go.  Just create your first account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on your server, you might have to create some folders and change their permissions.  If so, Broadcast Machine will let you know--just follow the instructions.</p>
