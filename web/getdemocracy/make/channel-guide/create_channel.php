<h2>Create a Channel</h2>

<p>Once you've installed the publishing software, creating a channel happens in seconds.  Simply choose a name for the channel, fill out some description fields, and customize your settings.  Your channel will be created instantly and a you'll have a link that users can use to subscribe.  The publishing software will automatically create both a 'feed' of new content as well as a library display of everything that's been offered on the channel (<a href="user_experience.php">learn more</a>).</p>

<p>You can make as many channels as you'd like and offer specific videos in any or all of them at the same time.</p>
