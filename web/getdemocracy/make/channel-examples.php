				<h2>Uses of the Democracy platform</h2>

			<h6>Meet some people and groups already using Democracy to publish their own internet TV channels.</h6>
				<p>The Democracy platform is available to everyone, large or small, for-profit or non-profit, no matter what the state of your video publishing setup. In fact, the Democracy Channel Guide features more than 300 channels of video content to watch, everyhthing from news to comedy to video blogs.</p>

				<p>Here are some examples of different types of channels that illustrate how individuals and organizations can use Democracy to spread their videos, engage their membership, and pioneer new genres of video programming.</p>

The short "pod" segments make for great, bite-sized internet TV, and publishing to Democracy gives viewers another chance to catch the videos other than during their regular broadcast schedule.</p>

			<h6>Digerati University - <em>(technology and education)</em></h6>
				<p>Digerati University broadcasts free video tutorials of popular Mac software. The channel is published by the <a href="http://www.memap.org/">Maine Media Art Project</a>, a volunteer project in Maine working to educate students with free in-school workshops - and now online for everyone.</p>
