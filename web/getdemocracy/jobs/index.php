<h3>Software Developer</h3>

<p>
<strong>Software Developer</strong> - We're looking for a solid programmer who can work
independently, communicate well, and occasionally step back from the
code to contemplate improvements to program architecture or our
development process. Most of our code is in dynamic languages like Python and Ruby, so a clear understanding of language concepts is important.
</p>
<p><strong>TO APPLY</strong>: Send a short note about why you're interested in working with us along with a casual resume or description of what your skills / experience is to jobs[at]pculture.org.

<h3>Art Director</h3>

<p>We're looking for someone who meshes with our vision of graphic and interface design (see more details in the section below this).</p>

<p>Design is the trickiest piece of the puzzle for us.   We are looking to hire a full or part-time designer to create web designs, graphics, logos, and application interfaces, though we are also interested in contract work.  We want to find someone who is smart and flexible and has a good sense of style.  Design we like includes:  <a href="http://basecamphq.com/">this</a>, <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/portfolio/mozilla-logos">this</a>, <a href="http://acquisitionx.com/">this</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">this</a>, and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">this</a> (also <a href="http://www.tuxdog.org/">this</a>).  In general, we care a lot about details and usability and are striving to make websites and applications that are world-class in look and feel.  If you are an ambitious designer and want to kick ass in the name of good, please send us your portfolio.</p>

<p>We are expecting to hire for a half or full-time position, as described above, but if you'd like to apply for a long-term consulting contract, we would consider that as well.  Please let us know what kind of arrangement works best for you.</p>
