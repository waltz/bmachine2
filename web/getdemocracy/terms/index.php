  <h1 >Channel Guide Terms Of Use</h1>
  <p>By using the Channel Guide, a service of Participatory Culture Foundation ("PCF"), you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions ("Terms of Use").</p>
  <h2>Basic Terms</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>You must be 13 years and older to use this site.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for any activity that occurs under your user name.</li>
    <li>You are solely responsible for the audio and video posted in your channel.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for keeping your password secure.</li>
    <li>You are solely responsible for your conduct and any data, text, information, screen names, graphics, photos, profiles, audio and video clips, links ("Content") that you submit, post, and display on the Channel Guide service.</li>
    <li>You must not abuse, harass, threaten, impersonate or intimidate other Channel Guide users.</li>
    <li>You must not transmit any worms or viruses or any code of a destructive nature.    </li>
    <li>You must not create or submit unwanted messages to any other Channel Guide users ("Spam").</li>
    <li>You must not, in the use of the Channel Guide, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright laws).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Violation of any of these agreements will result in the termination of your Channel Guide account. While PCF prohibits such conduct and content on its site, you understand and agree that PCF cannot be responsible for the Content posted on its web site and you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials and that you use the Channel Guide service at your own risk.</p>
  <h2>General Conditions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Channel Guide service for any reason, without notice at any time.</li>
    <li>We reserve the right to alter these Terms of Use at any time. If the alterations constitute a material change to the Terms of Use, we will notify you via internet mail according to the preference expressed on your account. What constitutes a "material change" will be determined at our sole discretion, in good faith and using common sense and reasonable judgement.</li>
    <li>We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.</li>
    <li>We may, but have no obligation to, remove Content and accounts containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion are unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene or otherwise objectionable or violates any party's intellectual property or these Terms of Use.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Copyright</h2>
  <p>First, PCF has no control over the content of the channels, and has no way to unsubscribe existing subscribers from any channel. What's more, each of these channels may be accessible from dozens of other websites and guides as well as the channel owner's website, so the channel could continue to get many new subscribers even after being removed from the Channel Guide. Thus, if you want a piece of content removed from circulation, the best way to do that is to contact the channel owner or their ISP, not us. You get both "one-stop shopping" and a more complete solution to your problem.</p>
  <p>That said...</p>
  <h2>DMCA Policy</h2>
  <p>It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf">www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf</a>) and other applicable intellectual property laws, which may include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity. If we remove or disable access to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of each affected site so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of that Act. It is our policy to document all notices of alleged infringement on which we act. A copy of the notice will be sent to a third party who will make it available to the public.</p>
  <h2>Infringement Notification</h2>
  <p>To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide a written communication (by fax or regular mail -- not by email, except by prior agreement) that sets forth the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that a product or activity is infringing your copyrights. Indeed, in a recent case (please see <a href="http://www.onlinepolicy.org/action/legpolicy/opg_v_diebold/">www.onlinepolicy.org/action/legpolicy/opg_v_diebold/</a> for more information), a company that sent a infringement notification seeking removal of online materials that were protected by the fair use doctrine was ordered to pay such costs and attorneys fees. The company agreed to pay over $100,000. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material available online infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.</p>

  <h2>Counter Notification</h2>

  <p> To file a counter notification with us, you must provide a written communication (by fax or regular mail -- not by email, except by prior agreement) that sets forth the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that a product or activity is not infringing the copyrights of others. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether certain material infringes the copyrights of others, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
