%Providers of Internet video have recently seen an explosion in users\foonote{"We're seeing an explosion in the popularity of television content with Internet audiences, and Time Life's video library is growing every day," said Adam Berrey, vice president of marketing and strategy, Brightcove. "Using Brightcove enables Time Life to bring video content directly to its fans with experiences that communicate its brand and integrate directly into online fan sites and social networks." According to \url{ http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/12-12-2006/0004489645&EDATE=} }.

\section{About the Participatory Culture Foundation}
    The Participatory Culture Foundation is a 501c(3) non-profit organization dedicated to the creation of a democratic mass medium through internet technology.
Based in Massachussetts, it was founded by Worcester natives Nick Reville, Tiffiniy Cheng, Holmes Wilson, and WPI alunmus Nick Nassar.

    PCF seeks to achieve its goal of democratizing the media through their open-source Internet TV platform, consisting of several pieces.
Democracy Player allows users to download and watch videos from all over the world via RSS channels.
Still in beta, Democracy Player has been rapidly expanding its user base as it draws closer to a 1.0 release.
In the month of November 2006 alone, the application was downloaded over 15,000 times\footnote{Citation/Number update needed}.

Integrated seamlessly with Democracy, the Channel Guide serves as an open directory for internet television channels, ranging from local citizen journalism to major network programming.
Any video publisher may submit their show to the Channel Guide, which users can then peruse by category from within Democracy.

Videobomb is a website for aggregating the best videos online, allowing users to create custom channels of videos from all over the web.
Users post content that they think is noteworthy.
Other users may "Star" the video, which bookmarks it as a favorite.
The newest and most popular videos are aggregated onto the site's front page, or downloaded via feeds that integrate with Democracy Player. 

\section{What is Democracy Player?}
Democracy player is the principal component in the collection of tools that make PCF's Internet television platform possible.
Democracy Player is a cross-platform media player that has built in support for reading Internet TV channels.
Democracy Player can read any RSS feed with embedded video and organize the videos in a clear, logical way.
When looking though Internet TV channels, the videos are listed by date.
Each video has a thumbnail, a short description, various meta-data, a link to rate the content, and a link to share the content with friends.
The software enables users to easily subscribe to free Internet TV channels.
In other words, Democracy will automatically download any new content from an RSS feed that contains embedded video content.
The videos are stored for certain period of time (5 days by default) before being deleted.
Democracy Player is different than web services like You Tube in that it does not provide hosting for videos, instead only acting as an aggregator for video content that is hosted elsewhere on the web.

\section {What is the Channel Guide?}
Democracy makes viewing Internet TV channels easy, but without a central directory of free channels, it might be hard to find interesting channels.
Channel Guide makes finding free Internet TV channels easy.
It is a website that is embedded in Democracy that centralizes information about popular free Internet TV channels.
It allows users to easily browse, subscribe to, comment on, and rate free channels.
It's built into Democracy, so it's easy to find.
Channel Guide had hundreds of channels about everything from citizens news channels, such as Democracy Now!\footnote { http://DemocracyNow.org} and Rocketboom\footnote {http://Rocketboom.com}, to independent music video channels like TeleMusicVision\footnote{ http://telemusicvision.com}.
It is also possible for users to create their own channel guides and distribute their own branded versions of Democracy Player.

\section{What is Broadcast Machine?}
    The final piece of the platform is Broadcast Machine, a tool that allows video producers to publish their content online.
    Broadcast Machine began as Blog Torrent, a small application that simplified the creation and sharing of torrent files, as well as acting as a light-weight BitTorrent download client.
Broadcast Machine built on that foundation, expanding the application to a full-featured toolkit for internet video publishers (commonly referred to as vloggers).
It not only handles video distribution via BitTorrent, but also supports direct downloads, syndication, categorization (tagging), extensive information about the videos themselves, and more.
Broadcase Machine uses open standard to ensure compatibility with many feed readers, like Democracy Player, RSSowl, LifeRea and iTunes.
The software organizes video content in a way that makes it easy for the layperson to download video, subscribe to channels, and share content with friends.

\section {Why do we need Broadcast Machine?}
    Broadcast Machine is an amagalmation of features from a number of different pieces of software.
It is a type of content management systems, much like Drupal\footnote{\url{http://Drupal.org}} and Civic Space\footnote{\url{http://CivicSpaceLabs.org} }.
Since there regular posts make up the main content in Broadcast Machine, it also is somewhat similar to blog software like Word Press \footnote{\url{http://WordPress.org}} and Movable Type \footnote{\url{ http://MovableType.com}}.
In fact, The Channel Channel, one of the default channels in Democracy Player, is powered by a customized version of Word Press.
Broadcast Machine is different from these pieces of software in that it primarily manages video content and it adds the videos to Democracy compatible channels.
Since current CMS's were not designed with large files in mind, hosting video files can lead to extreme strain on the server.
Broadcast Machine solves the problem of high demand for bandwidth by using BitTorrent to distribute video content.
With a number of custom plugins and work-arounds, each of these pieces of software could undoubtedly accomplish the goals of Broadcast Machine.
However, since none of these pieces of software were not designed with video content in mind, the work required to get them to support all the requirements of Broadcast Machine is comparable to writing Broadcast Machine from scratch.
It would probably cost us more time to first read and understand the existing code of a CMS or blog software and then turn it into what we need, than it would to just start from scratch.
Below we will discuss the pros and cons of these pieces of software and explain more why it is neccesary for us to design a new architecture for Broadcast Machine.
	
\section {The importance of open-source}
    Open source software is an important part of the movement to democratize the media and Internet.
This common goal is what ties together PCF's mission with that of the Free Software Movement.
The goal of the Free Software Movement is to create software to increase the freedom of the public in general.\footnote{Richard Stallman, Why Software Should Be Free (\url{ http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/shouldbefree.html})}
Open-Source Software accomplishes this through its transparency, which inspires community development of software, and gives users the freedom to modify the software to suit their needs.
The software is Free in the sense that there are no conditions in distributing or using it, except that users respect the freedom of the software.

    Without Free software, the Internet could not exist as a democratic medium.
Proprietary (meaning closed-source) software limits what users can or can't do with it, and does not give users the ability to modify code.
With proprietary software, users cannot \"own\" software, even if they purchase it.
Instead, users pay for the privilege of using it.
Under this model, the software is less accessible and less usable (as users cannot fix problems on their own, and must rely on proprietary developer support).
On top of this, other developers cannot learn from existing code, or base new work on it without paying costly licensing fees.\footnote{ibid} 
    Open-source software aims to build a cultural community of developers who can use each other as resources, learning from existing code, and freely building upon it to create new technologies altogether.
This culture encourages technological progress in ways that competitive, closed-source software does not. 

\section {Similar Technologies}

\subsection {Drupal & Civicspace}
%Needs: How Drupal Modules Work
Drupal is a content managment system, often referred to as a CMS. 
A CMS is a computer software system that assists users in managing internet content.
It helps users organize, control, and publish content.
Drupal allows users to easily set up and create and moderate blogs, forums, webpages, newsletters, and picture galleries\footnote{According to \url{ http://drupal.org/about}}.
It's written in PHP and requires either MySQL v3.23.17 or higher or PostgreSQL 7.2 or higher\footnote{As of Dec 11, according to \url{ http://drupal.org/requirements}.}.
Thousands of popular sites use Drupal\footnote{As of Dec 15, 2006, according to \url{http://DrupalSites.com}}, including The Onion\footnote{\url{ http://TheOnion.com}}, OurMedia\footnote{\url{http://www.ourmedia.org/}}, and MTV's UK site\footnote{\url{http://mtv.co.uk/} }.
The IndyMedia network is also considering using Drupal as the base for their new website\footnote{As of Dec 15, 2006, according to \url{https://docs.indymedia.org/view/Global/IndymediaAlternatives} }.

Civicspace, formerly known as DeanSpace and Hack4Dean, was born of a distribution of Drupal developed for Howard Dean's 2004 presidental campaign website\footnote{\url{ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeanSpace}}.
CivicSpace features an installer and many pre-configured plugins that are meant to help run political and charitable websites.
CivicSpace is used by a huge number of websites, somewhere around 40,000 sites\footnote{As of Dec 11, according to a google search for \"powered by CivicSpace\".}, such as The New Democratic Party\footnote{\url{ http://www.ndp.ca}}, Better Donkey\footnote{\url{http://BetterDonkey.org}}, Blog for America\footnote{\url{ http://www.blogforamerica.com/}}, and Oregon's Bus Project\footnote{\url{http://www.busproject.org}}.
As of version 5.0, Drupal includes an automatic installer and many of the functionality that set CivicSpace apart from Drupal are being included in the base software.
%templating system
%architechture

\subsubsection {Templating and Themes}
%Needs: Template code examples
Drupal has a very flexible templating system. 
It has a built in theme system and supports a number of common engines. 
A theme can be formed in several ways. 
As of version 5.0, Drupal interfaces with Smarty, XTemplate, and PHPTemplate. 

Themes are stored in individual directories under the Drupal theme directory. 
Each theme directory bears the name of the theme and at least contains the following files:
logo.png - an image that will be displayed next to the url of in a viewer's browser
screenshot.png - an image that will be displayed in the administration inferface. 
It's meant to give users deciding on a new theme a preview of how the theme will look before they switch. 
style.css - a CSS file containing all of the styling information about the theme. 

Depending on what method the theme developer uses to create the theme, there will need to be a number of other files included in the theme's directory. 
There are a few ways to properly form a new theme for Drupal. 
One of the most common ways is for the theme developer to create a PHP file with a .theme extension that includes functions that override the default theme functions, as well as HTML or XHTML. 
The functions defined in this file is used in conjunction with the style.css file to create the layout of the page. 
Chameleon is an example of a theme that was designed using a .theme file, although it is primarily CSS driven. 
The Chameleon theme directory contains the following files: 
Chameleon.theme - the PHP file that contains the theme_functions 
style.css - the primary style sheet
common.css -  another style sheet that has more styling info
screnshot.png, logo.png - images used by the administration interface
background.png - simple background image


Alternatively, a new theme can be created by using one of the supported theme engines. 
A developer determines which templating engine he/she is going to use and creates a file with a .xtmpl, .tpl, or a .tpl.php extension. 
Supported templating engines include: XTemplate, PHPTemplate, and Smarty. 
Pushbutton and Bluebeach are two themes that are distributed with Drupal that were created using this method. 
Bluebeach was originally written as a XTemplate theme, but was later ported to be a smarty-based theme. 


A quick way to create a new theme is to use a theme that is already in existance and simply create a new style sheet that changes the layout and look. 
Marvin and Box Cleanslate are themes that were both created by editing the existing style sheets of previous themes. 
Marvin is based on Chameleon and Cleanslate is based upon Box_grey.  


PHPTemplate is a theme engine created by Adrian Rossouw specifically for the Drupal project. 
Unlike Smarty and XTemplate, it does not need to be interpreted by another theme engine. 
This means PHPtemplate can execute faster. 
Every PHPTemplate file contains an HTML skeleton with some simple PHP statements for the dynamic data. 
PHPTemplate is a good choice for theme developers who know a bit of PHP, just like in Word Press, with some basic PHP snippets you can create complicated themes easily. 
On the flip-side PHPTemplate is not good for people who are new to programming, or don't know any PHP. 
Although theme designers do not neccesarily need to understand what the php snipets do, requiring code in the template could confuse the designers and could easily lead to trouble. 
Code in the templates is a major drawback of the PHPTemplating engine. 
It makes template design less accessible to ordinary users. 


XTemplate is much different than PHPTemplate and the theme engine built in to Drupal, but in many ways it's similar Smarty. 
It separates the layout into three layers: logic, structure, and style, making it easy for theme designers to create and modify templates. 
Designer need not even see the logic layer to make a new theme or modify an existing one. 
This logic layer is made up of all the php code necessary to make the theme run. 
It contains all of the functions required to interface the template with Drupal. 
The structure layer consists of an XHTML code. 


\section {XHTML}
XHTML, or the Extensible HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language that allows the same amount of versatility as HTML, but with a stricter syntax. 
HTML is an application of the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a very versatile markup language, whereas XHTML is an application of XML, a more restrictive subset of SGML. 
XHTML is a reformulation of HTML in XML, so in many ways its a cross between XML and HTML. 
Because XHTML code needs to be well-formed and syntactically correct, XHTML documents allow for automated processing to be performed using a standard XML library. 
This is unlike HTML, which due to its leniency requires a relatively complex and usually custom parser. 

XHTML 1.0 became an official World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation on January 2000. 


XTemplate templates are directories located in the Drupal /themes/ directory. 
Each theem directory contains all the XHTML/HTML, CSS, images and JavaScript files that the template uses. 



Drupal templating engine does not end at providing theming for just individual installs. 
It also provides module programmers with the ability to theme the software they create. 


\subsection {Architecture}
Drupal allows developers to create and contribute modules that inferface with the base code and modify or enhance the functionality of the software. 
Drupal stores all module information in the directory named modules, which is located in the root directory. 
The Drupal website maintains a list of a number of popular modules. 
They're typically distributed as tarballs or zip files. 
Users copy the compressed file to their webserver and decompress the contents into the modules directory. 
Modules are usually stored in their individual folders, but this is not a neccesary by design. 
Each module must contain a ModuleName.module file that contains 


CivicSpace is an offshoot of Drupal that began as an install of Drupal with a number of modules that make running a political or charitable website easier. 



\subsection{Smarty Templating}
Smarty is often called a templating engine, but is better described as a template or presentation framework.

\chapter{BitTorrent}
%Should info like this be included as an appendix?
\section{Overview}
BitTorrent is a protocol for distributing large amounts of data across a network.
Decentralized in design, The BitTorrent protocol allows individuals with limited upstream bandwidth to easily distribute files, minimizing the server load by sharing the bandwidth costs associated with file sharing.

Currently the most popular form of filesharing, BitTorrent has changed the way that people share files on the Internet, making filesharing more democratic and accessible to ordinary users.
According to research conducted by Terry Shaw of CableLabs, and Jim Martin, a computer science professor at Clemson University, 60 percent of American teens equipped with broadband have downloaded audio and video files over peer-to-peer networks. \footnote { \url{http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6332098.html}}
In the same research paper, Shaw and Martin report that they found that 18\% of all broadband traffic, both upstream and downstream, is used for torrenting .
Additionally, 55\% of broadband upstream (ie "home outward") is used for torrenting.
According to CacheLogic, a British web-analysis company, BitTorrent accounts for only 35 percent of traffic on the Internet, which is still more than all other peer-to-peer programs combined.  
Although researched statistics often vary, by all accounts BitTorrent is responsible for a huge percentage of Internet traffic.\footnote {\url{http://in.tech.yahoo.com/041103/137/2ho4i.html}}

Bit Torrent has been criticized for enabling users to infringe upon copyright laws by sharing files illegally. Some Universities, including WPI, have gone to extreme measures to block access to the Bit Torrent protocol, despite its wide variety of legitimate uses, including the inexpensive distribution of independent media.


\section{Why is Bit Torrent Important?}
%rewriting

\section{The Process}
%Got to figure out how to include pictures. I converted the two images I wanted to include in this section to post script. They're in this folder.
To begin sharing files using the Bit Torrent protocol, users first need to install a Bit Torrent client.
Popular clients include ABC, Azureus, BitTornado, TorrentStorm, and µTorrent. The same client is used to both upload and download Bit Torrent files.
The original host of the file, called the seeder, uses a Bit Torrent client to hash the file, breaking it up logically into hundreds of small pieces, while still leaving the original file intact.
Meta-data about the file is stored in a torrent file with the .torrent extension.
Meta-data stored in this file includes, information about the files to be shared, how the data is cut up, and information about the host computer that will be seeding the files.
This torrent file is then distributed to the people who are interested in downloading the data and is opened by a Bit Torrent client located on their personal computer.
The torrent file can be distributed in many ways.
Torrent files are very small, usually only a few kilobytes. They can be attached to an email, put on a website, posted on forums, etc.
To support the distribution of torrents, a new type of web-software has emerged, called a torrent tracker.
Torrent trackers helps organize many torrent files into a single website. These websites generally record even more metadata than the data in the torrent files, such as the files title, its author, a website associated with the file, perhaps a description or review of the file.
They also provide a the ability to search for a specific file. ChomskyTorrents.org is an example of a public torrent tracker.
Once a user opens a torrent file with their client, they begin downloading pieces of that file.
Users who are currently downloading the file are designated as peers, and the collection of peers downloading the file is referred to as the swarm.
Initially, there is only one seeder in the swarm.
The seeder starts by sends different pieces of the file to as many peers as possible. 
As peers finish downloading pieces of the file, they then share those pieces with the rest of the swarm, distributing the upstream bandwidth load amongst all peers and seeders. 
Once a peer finishes downloading the file, he or she can then leave the file open, and serves as a seeder by continuing to distribute the file to other peers.
The seeder and the peers connect to one another sharing pieces of the file until everyone in the swarm has every piece of the file.

\section{An Example}
Let's say that a woman in Oaxaca, MX films the Mexican Federal Police attacking teachers on strike for better pay.
She then creates a video file called HumanRightsAbusesInOaxaca-Nov162006.avi. She opens her Bit Torrent client and generates a torrent file.
A new file called, HumanRightsAbusesInOaxaca-Nov162006.avi.torrent is created that logically partitions the original file into several pieces (leaving the original file unchanged), using simple hashes.
She begins seeding the file and sends the torrent file to 100 of her contacts in the United States.
% \includegraphics{oaxaca1.ps}
These 100 people download the torrent file and open it in their Bit Torrent client of choice.
The client now has a list of all the pieces of the file, and can begin requesting them.
The computer in Mexico begins by sending the first piece of the video file to Contact \#1, the second piece of the video file to Contact \#2, the third piece to Contact \#3, and so on.
Once some contact finishing downloading their piece of the video file, he or she can then share that piece with every other peer in the swarm.
Now, the computer in Mexico, the seeder, can concentrate on only sharing pieces of the file that only it has.
% \includegraphics{oaxaca2.ps}
Immediately every client in the swarm, ie every contact in the US, is both uploading and downloading the video file at the same time.
The load is distributed among every client in the swarm.
Furthermore, once the person in Mexico has sent 1 copy of every piece to some person in the swarm, the swarm can finish sharing the file by itself.
Keeping the original seeder in the swarm will speed up the process, but its not necessary as long as every piece of the file exists somewhere in the swarm.
For example, if the original seeder loses her connection to the Internet, the file can still be shared and distributed among the swarm.

\chapter{Current Issues}
Before creating the next incarnation of Broadcast Machine, we need to understand its current shortcomings.
The first step in addressing problems is understanding what they are.
There are a few issues that are often brought up by users and a few more that the developers are concerned about.
There are two larger issues that the developers hold responsible for the majority of Broadcast Machine bugs.
Although the API is thoroughly documented, the data structures have little documentation.
This along with poor application architecture are the two culprits that cause the majority of problems.
These problems are becoming more important to address as Participatory Culture's flagship product Democracy Player grows in popularity and drives the demand for video content management software like Broadcast Machine.
The problems mentioned by users are important to address, but after a while it becomes less efficient to quash bugs than it is to address the cause of these bugs.
We hope that by re-architecting the software we can simulatneously address existing issues and improve on the overall product.
For example, many users would like to adapt their installations to custom environments, but this is made difficult by the current architecture and understanding the current codebase is made difficult by vauge or nonexistent documentation.
With over 20,000 current installs of Broadcast Machine there is certainly a community that would be well served by a rebuilt applictation. \footnote{A search for "Powered by Broadcast Machine" on Google returns upwards of 20,000 results. \url{ http://www.google.com/search?q=\%22Powered+by+Broadcast+Machine\%22}}

Many successful applications, including Broadcast Machine, are architected in such a way that the program is split up into three distinct parts.
This design pattern is most commonly known as "Model-View-Controller (MVC)".
This design methodology separates the application into distinct parts that can be modified without having a detrimental effect on other parts of the program.
The three sections are divided up as follows: The first is the Model which describes how the data in the program is stored, the second is the View which is responsible for how the program interacts with the user and the third is the Controller which bridges the gap between Model and View by responding to events sent by the other components.
Broadcast Machine currently implements this design, albeit poorly.
Unfortunately, the separation between the three segments is often unclear.
    
The majority of the separation problems occur in the 'Model' layer.
Currently Broadcast Machine is structured so that the model is contained in two files, datastore.php and data\_layer.php.
The application uses each of these files to store data and handle the return of data in an understandable manner.
The model can store data in one of two ways, it can insert the data into a MySQL database or it can store the data using a flat-file mechanism.
Datastore.php and data\_layer.php are fantastically intertwined.
Each of the files provides some sort of functionality that the other relies upon.
Through the use of various function hooks, the data layer and the data store are constantly communicating with each other to determine where and how they should store received information.
This intercommunication becomes a problem when the a user or developer changes something in either one.
When changes are made at either place in the program, the other part might fail.
It is hard to be sure what effects changes will have because of this hook system.
Because the hooks are established at runtime, determining which function will be called is often difficult.

The second area in which Broadcast Machine is lacking is documentation.
While there is enough user end documentation to support the existing community there is certainly room for improvement.
The walkthroughs are often only a paragraph long and describe a bare minimum of features available in Broadcast Machine.
The occasional screenshot helps out by showing the user where to navigate, but this is unfortunately in the minority of cases.
Supporting the end user is certainly an issue for a project that wishes to put powerful software in the hands of users, but even more alarming is the sparse developer documentation.
An open-source project like Broadcast Machine can and should leverage the expertise of the community to build a better product and the lack of API documentation and comments in the code only make it more difficult for other developers to improve upon the software.
There are a few files that begin to talk about the data structures used in the program, but it stops short.
While it is certainly a good start, it needs to be cleaned up and completed. There is a certain amount of inline documentation as well, but it is far from complete.
The comments that are there describe why the variables are there, but fail to mention how the a function might work or what effects it has on other parts of the application.
Between architecture and documentation, there are significant portions that Broadcast Machine need improvement.

\chapter{Requirements and Design Decisions}

\section{Architecture}

    Many of Broadcast Machine's current problems stem from its poor architectural implementation.
To prevent these problems from happening in the future, Broadcast Machine must have a carefully planned architecture.
From a design standpoint, a successful architecture has several requirements. 

The application must be designed so that a user with only basic HTML and CSS knowledge can easily customize the website to suit his or her needs.
Ideally, users' site layouts, or "themes", have the potential to look drastically different.
The templates must be abstracted from the functional code, so that users needn't worry about damaging the code or digging deep into its inner workings when modifying the layout.
Users should also have the ability to easily switch between layouts.

Along the same lines, the code must be structured so that it is easily maintainable and extendable by any developer.
The layout of the application should appear logical and concise.
In the event that bugs occur, localizing them to a specific section of code and implementing a fix should be possible without the fix appearing hacked together or thrown in.
Developers should not need to dig through a mountain of code before finding the section that they need to edit.
If features need to be added, the developers should be able to do so while maintaining the same architectural pattern and preserving the structure of the application.
In this sense, a good architecture will encourage good design practices. 

The application must be flexible enough so that it can be re-factored easily.
Functionality should be abstracted and delegated so that major changes to one part of the code do not affect the others.
For example, we may decide later that we would like to use a different type of database.
We should be able to swap out the back end without having to modify the entire application, and without significantly affecting the user experience.
For these reasons, we have chosen a Model-View-Controller design pattern to represent our application.

\section{Compatibility}

The new Broadcast Machine must work across several different platforms.
While impossible to guarantee compatibility with all web server configurations, Broadcast Machine most work on the most common web server setups.
This includes any Apache web server with a minimal amount of installed modules, and most major hosting services (Dreamhost, 1And1, etc).

For this reason, we decided that the program’s front end should be written in PHP, while the back end data layer will be represented by a MySQL database. 
Although Ruby on Rails is great for a Model-View-Controller web application (as it enforces the architecture by its nature, and automatically generates and maintains basic interactions between the layers), it hasn’t been fully adopted by most of the web community. 
Very few hosting services include Ruby in their hosting plan, and setting up Rails manually is a task beyond our target user-base. 
Ruby is not perfect, it too has its draw backs, but in our opinion it would be very well suited for Broadcast Machine. 
However, since it is not well supported we will not use it. 
PHP, while a less than perfect programming language, comes pre-configured with most Apache installs, and is available with most, if not all, web hosting plans. 

Similarly, MySQL is an open-source DBMS (Database Management System) that is perhaps the most widely used SQL (Structured Query Language) implementation, with the exception of enterprise-level applications such as Oracle. 
Like PHP, MySQL comes installed by default with most hosting plans, and setting up a database to be used with our application is a matter of running a script with the correct permissions. 

When choosing our DBMS, we must also predict how the application will scale with databases of varying sizes.
An assumption that the average database will contain less than 1000 records for unique videos is reasonable.
A publisher who produces a show daily would take almost three years to reach 1000 records, and most publishers release videos somewhat less frequently.
Most of the queries on the database will be basic select statements for getting data, and insert or alter statements for adding or modifying video information.
The predicted scale and function of our database would be best suited for a minimalist DBMS such as SQLite, which optimizes access to the data layer for smaller databases that do not need advanced functionality.
Ideally, the program will be flexible enough to use SQLite when available, and require MySQL in all other instances.
Architecting a flexible database controller will allow us to add other DBMS choices as necessary. 

\section{Ease of Use}

    The most obvious requirement for Broadcast Machine is that it be easy to use.
Our target user, people who produce videos, should not need a wealth of technical knowledge in order to deploy and use the program.
Just as we have almost no knowledge of how to shoot or edit a video, we should not expect the user to have any knowledge of PHP, RSS, or any of the technical concepts employed.
Without being privy to any of the inner workings of the program, the user must be able to easily and intuitively publish videos and video "channels" via a simple administrative interface.
Without any information besides their web server login and password, the user should be able to set up Broadcast Machine by dropping the application in their public html folder.
The program should auto-configure itself on the first-run with a few simple clicks, even if the user is completely unaware of how his or her web server is set up.
The application must detect server configurations that may interfere with its behavior, and handle those special cases gracefully.
Another way in which we will keep the install simple, is by using only one install directory.
We will not include any directory structure in the install file, but rather an install script will create any neccesary directories after decompression of the install file.
Sometimes during decompression of files, the directory structure of is lost.
By keeping all install files in one directory and creating a directory structure with an install script will ensure that all the neccesary directories exists and have the proper permissions.

Likewise, viewers with any level of computer proficiency must be able to easily browse and download videos, leave comments and feedback, and subscribe to their favorite channels in Democracy Player (See use cases for more information).
 

\section{Stability}

    Most importantly, the new Broadcast Machine must be stable.
At the very least, it should preserve all of the functionality of its previous incarnation, while containing none of the bugginess or unpredictable behavior.

\section{Features}
% This is just an outline right now. -Greg
There are several requirements for features that Broadcast Machine must include:
 * Automatic generation of RSS feeds
 * Templating system
 * Server-side sharing for BitTorrent
 * Tagging
 * A granular permission system

\section{Existing Data Model}
%I don't know where else to put this for now... -Greg

\subsection{Instances}
	The instance table was used to prevent two versions of Broadcast Machine from using the same database. It consists of a hash string of the hostname (id), and a timestamp for when the instance was created (time). This table can be replaced by a field in the channel settings for the base url of the website.

\subsection{Stats}
	The stats table tracked the number of downloads for each file. It contained a unique hash of the filename (id), and an integer for the number of downloads (downloads). The table has a one-to-one relationship with files, so in the future download statistics will be merged into a single field in the file table.

\subsection{BitTorrent}
	The torrents table stored metadata for BitTorrent files. It tracked the hash checksum for the torrent file (info_hash), the name of the file itself (filename), and a binary file containing the torrent itself. Filename was required to be unique, and the info_hash served as the primary key for the table. In the new schema, this will be expanded to include much more metadata usually associated with torrent trackers.

	The peers table was used to keep track of users who downloaded or were in the process of downloading a file. It contained an info_hash to designate which torrent file the peer was downloading from, the user's IP address, the port they were using to connect, whether or not they had completed the file (seeder), and a timestamp for when the user connected to the swarm (time). The table was indexed by time, with a combination of ip, port, and the info_hash server as a primary key (meaning that no two entries could share the same data for all three fields). 

\subsection{Channels}

	The channels table was used to store metadata about specific RSS video feeds, or channels. It contained a unique integer identifier (ID, the primary key), A text explanation of the channel (description), and integer number for when the channel was made (Created), a text title for the channel (name), fields for URLs of linked icons, libraries, and the channel's main website (Icon, LibraryURL, and WebURL, respectively), a field to designate the publisher (Publisher). In addition to this, it has several tiny int values that served as settings flags, with 0 being false, and the default value, and 1 being true. This includes OpenPublish, RequireLogin, and NotPublic. It also contains CSSURL, which would store a link to an external style sheet to be used in rendering the channel page. This field will be deprecated by the new templating system.

	The channel_options table keeps track of the individual settings for a given channel. Since this is one-to-one with channels, these two tables may be merged in the future. Each record in the table contains an integer reference to the channel it refers to (ID), And boolean flags for the following properties: Creator, Description, Filesize, Keywords, Length, Published, Thumbnail, Title, Torrent, URL. there is also a tiny int field called SubscribeOptions, whose default value is 7.

	The channel_files table records associations between the channels table and the files table (see below). In other words, it tracks which files are attached to which channels. It contains a reference to the channel in question (channel_id), the hash of the file (hash), and integer timestamp (thetime). The primary key is channel_id and hash, meaning that there can't be more than one record for any channel and file pair.

	The channel_sections table allows channels to be split up into several subsections. From experience, this seems to be widely unused by BM's user base, and is also not implemented in the RSS view. As such, it may be deprecated. The table itself contains an integer reference to the channel the record refers to (channel_id) and the name of the section (Name). The table also shares a one-to-one relationship with the channels table.

	Like channel_files, the section_files table tracks which files are associated with which sections. The table contains a reference to channel_id, a reference to the name of the section, and the hash of the file. The combination of those three fields are a primary key and must be unique.

\subsection{Videos}
	The table for storing video information is the files table. The name will have to change to videos, since it may be possible in the future to have multiple files associated with one video (for multiple formats/resolutions). The files table contains a unique integer identifier for each video (ID), an ineger for when the file was created (Created), the name of the file (FileName), the name of the person who created the channel (Creator), a text summary of the file (Description), a title (Title), an optional link to a transcript for the hearing-disabled (transcript), a link to a website for more information(Webpage), an optional donation code (donation_id), boolean flags for Excerpt, Explicit, ignore_mimetype, and External properties, and URL, in case the file was linked to externally. It also contains a link to an image thumnail of the video (Image), name and URL of the license used to distribute the video (LicenseName, LicenseURL), the MIME-type of the file (Mimetype), an integer for the date published (Publishdate), and the date of the video release via three fields: ReleaseDay, ReleaseMonth, and ReleaseYear (all are integers). Also included is a short string called Rights, which is slightly redundant due to the License fields. The files table contains the runtime of the video via three fields, RuntimeHours, RuntimeMinutes, and RuntimeSeconds. These fields will be combined into one runtime field representing the time in seconds, which will be converted into the h:mm:ss format in the file view rather than at the data-layer level.

	Records of people who have contributed to the making of a video were stored in the file_people table. The table contained an identifier for which video the credit refers to (ID), their name (name), and what they were credited for (role). The combination of these three values were required to be unique as a primary key.

	"Tags", or categories to classify videos by, were stored in the file_keywords table. This table contained an ID reference to the video, and then the keyword that the video would be tagged by. Although one video may have had many tags, no video could have two identical tags.

\subsection{Donations}
	The donation table stores information on how users can contribute to the makers of a video. Each donation record had a unique ID, an e-mail address (email), a short description (title), and a longer text donation pitch (text). Putting this information in its own table allowed publishers to frequently associate videos with the same donation info, as this info rarely changed. 

	The donation_files table links together donation info with video info. The table conatined the id of the donation info, as well as the hash id of the video (hash). Each video could only be linked to one set of donation information, so id and hash are both primary keys.

\subsection{Users}
	The user table contained information about registered users. This table contained an alias for each user (Username), the user's real name (Name), their encrypted password (Hash), their e-mail address (Email), when they registered (Created), and their permissions information (IsAdmin, IsPending). The primary field was Name, which may have caused problems when two people with the same name would attempt to register (e.g. two John Smiths would not be allowed to join at the same time). In the future, the primary key for the table should be username.

	The newusers table tracked only those users who have not verified their account. The table included a filehash, their password (Hash), their e- mail address (email), IsAdmin, and when they created the account (Created).

\subsection{Settings}
	Settings for the website itself was stored in a B-Encoded flat file. In the future, most of these settings will be migrated to the database. These fields include whether or not new user registration was allowed (AllowRegistration), whether or not they required approval (RequireRegApproval), whether or not they needed to verify their account (RequireRegAuth), whether or not users could upload or download anonymously (UploadRegRequired and DownloadRegRequired, respectively), the default channel (DefaultChannel), whether the site has channels that anyone could modify (HasOpenChannels), their current site layout (theme), title of the site, the site description, an image associated with the site, the base url for the site (baseurl), database connection settings (mysql_prefix, mysql_host, mysql_username, mysql_password, mysql_database, and mysql_verified), and BitTorrent sharing settings (Ping, sharing_enable, sharing_auto, sharing_python, sharing_actual_python, minport, maxport). Since we will be using http-seeding of torrents, some of these settings are expected to change.

\section{New Model}
%This will be changed and updated as the new schema comes along further
%Needs: People should be relational!
Broadcast Machine must keep track of several pieces of information pertaining to its entities (channels, files, etc.).
A comprehensive list of the data follows (entity relationships highlighted in bold):

\subsection{Data associated with Channels}
Channel ID – An arbitrary, unique number to identify the channel and  associate it with other entities
Title – Each Channel has a title, represented by a string
Description - A longer body of text that describes the channel's theme or content
Icon – Reference to the thumbnail image (See below)
Credits – A list of the channel creators and maintainers, or any other people involved.
Donation information – Represented as a snippet of HTML or a simple url.
Website information – A url to link to the channel's main web page.
Tags – 0 or more keywords associated with the channel, used for categorizing and browsing multiple channels.
Permissions – Rules about which users can access or modify the channel

\subsection{Data associated with channel tags:}
Video ID – A reference to the video that the tag describes
Tag name – A short word or phrase to categorize the channel

\subsection{Data associated with Users:}
ID – An arbitrary, unique number to identify the user and associate him/her with other entities
Username – The user's nickname or handle
Password – Self-explanatory
Email Address – Optionally used to verify registration
Permissions – User's access credentials for specific channels, files, and the site in general

\subsection{Data associated with Videos:}
ID – An arbitrary, unique number to identify the user and associate it with other entities
Title – A short amount of text to describe the video
Description - A longer body of text that describes the video's theme or content
Last Modified Date – A time stamp set every time any video information is changed.
Credits – A list of the channel creators and maintainers, or any other people involved.
Icon – Reference to the thumbnail image (See below)
Transcript (optional)– A text-version of the video's content or dialog for the hearing impaired
License/Copyright information – The name of the license associated with the content, and possibly a url to link to the full body of the license
Website url – A link to the video  or publisher's website
Release Date – The date and time the video was released to the public
Publish Date – A timestamp of when the video is made available to the public. note that this is different than release time (For example, a publisher might publish a movie that was released at an earlier time elsewhere).
Running time – The length of the video, in seconds
Adult – A boolean flag used for marking adult content
Donation information – Represented as a snippet of HTML or a simple url.
Tags – 0 or more keywords associated with the channel, used for categorizing and     browsing multiple channels.
Mime-type – The type of media that the file represents
Filename – the url or address on the server where the file is located
Size – the size of the file, in bytes.
Downloads – A running count of the number of users who have downloaded the file
BitTorrent Information (optional) – If the file is a torrent, additional information must be stored (see below)
Permissions – Rules about which users can access or modify the video

\subsection{Data associated with video tags:}
    Video ID – A reference to the video that the tag describes
    Tag name – A short word or phrase to categorize the video

\subsection{Data associated with icons:}
    Icon ID - A unique, autogenerated id number to identify the image
    Icon URL - The address of the icon
    Mime-Type - The type of file that the icon is


\subsection{Data associated with Torrents:}
(To be completed)

(Should we pop the schema itself in here?)

\subsection{Design Decisions}
The current schema departs from the previous data structures in many ways.
Previously, the data layer was represented as a flat-file database.
Although most of the data structures were organized in a normalized, logical way, there were several inconsistencies that needed to be reconciled.

First, several pieces of data were being improperly stored in the database. 
For example, channel and site settings were being stored in the database. 
This information doesn't typically belong in a relational data structure, simply because it does not interact with other entities, nor can it benefit from any of the features of a database. 
Instead, we decided that the data belongs in a simple, transparent configuration file as part of the template system. 
That way, data can be easily read and modified, both by the application and advanced users. 

Channel icons and video icons, are no longer exclusive, and have been combined into a single icon table.
This means that the same icon information can be used by both channels and videos. This will help eliminate duplicate data, and give users more choice in choosing icons.

The new schema also drops several fields and data structures that could be simplified or generated on the fly.
For example, in the previous version, thumbnails were represented as their own entities, because the database stored the mime-type as well as the file address.
Since most, if not all, browsers render images without an explicit mime-type, eliminating this field also allows us to simplify the schema by storing all of the thumbnail information in the channels and video tables themselves.
Similarly, fields like file extension, which can be derived from other data, have been pruned.
We also store information about intellectual property licenses that could be abstracted to its own table.
However, this doesn't provide any significant functional benefits, so the information has been moved to data fields in other tables. 
File data and video data have a one-to-one relationship, so it makes sense to merge them into one table.
This will normalize the table, which will optimize queries and simplify queries that access that data.

\chapter{Utilized Technologies}
With the incredible number of technologies available for use today, it can be difficult to choose which ones most appropriately address the problem we are aiming to solve. Broadcast Machine will be built so that the greatest number of people can use it, which translates to using the most common (and yet most appropriate) technologies at our disposal. At the same time, our group needs to be aware of what is feasible. Supporting Apache is certainly practical because Apache licenses are free while supporting Microsoft's IIS is unreasonable because of the cost to license the software and the time needed to support that platform. Interoperability with current software is important as well. Certainly there is a need to support the Democracy Player and other large video aggregators such as iTunes. The weight pulled by these applications is significant enough that we should provide content that is syndicated using RSS and downloadable via HTTP or BitTorrent.

\section{Apache}
%Apache almost always comes with PHP, configurations on a per-directory basis (.htaccess), by far the most common web server.
The Apache webserver is an excellent match for Broadcast Machine. It is one of the most popular webservers in use today \footnote{From a Netcraft survey from Oct. 1995 through Jan. 2007. /url{http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2007/01/05/january_2007_web_server_survey.html}} and is known for being extremely robust.
Because of its wide adoption, there are many modules that have been written to extend its functionality.
This flexibility only adds to the allure of Apache; As both the PHP language and URL rewriting are supported through these modules, this server package truly delivers. 
Unfortunately, Apache might not be available in all situations.
The likely runner-up would be Microsoft's Internet Information Services http server which can also provide us with PHP and URL rewriting, albeit in a less robust form.
The Microsoft provides many of the same features that Apache does, but with widespread adoption as the goal, Apache delivers.
Apache's market share dominates over Microsoft's server, making Apache the clear winner.

\section{PHP}
%We're using php because its the only thing guarunteed to be installed everywhere. Also, performance/scalability. Expand on the language.
When it comes to writing applications for the web, there are many choices, and while PHP probably doesn't provide the best performance, it is one of the most prevalent server-side scripting languages available.
For this program to be as successful as possible, we must leverage the popularity of certain technologies; even if that means sacrificing other maybe better technologies for the most popular.
The Ruby on Rails platform could allow us to more quickly develop our program, Java Enterprise Edition might let us scale better, and .NET might let us take advantage of the many languages web applications can be created in, but none of these offers a better mix than PHP.
PHP comes installed by default at many inexpensive webhosts, has a large community following, and there are many prexisiting libraries that we can utilize. 
These advantages are important enough to us that our team is willing to ignore problems with the language like it's lack of namespaces and the use of weakly typed variables. 

\section{SQL}
To store all of the information about the channels, videos and settings in Broadcast Machine, we decided that a database would be best. 
In the time since the last release, SQL databases have become increasingly more prevalent on the web.
The most current release of PHP (Version 5) was released with built-in SQLite support in addition to the already well supported MySQL backend.
We feel that a database lets us store and retrive data in the most scalable and efficient way possible without sacrificing the overall goals of the program.
The proliferation of database support makes us confident that requiring a relational database system will not deter many potential users.
An important note to make is that much of the database setup procedure can be semi-automated during the installation as it is in the weblog package WordPress.

\section{URL Rewriting}
As the internet has become amazingly popular and software packages have replaced humans in the role of content management URL's have become increasingly difficult for users to understand as they more often serve the needs of the software rather than the end user.
To solve this problem, we can utilize the technique of URL rewriting to turn the cryptic characters in the browser bar into meaningful and rememberable addresses.
When it comes to weblogs, many people encounter URL's that look something like "\url{http://www.weblog.net/posts.php?day=01041999}".
When it comes to developers on the web, that URL servers their purposes nicely.
But many end-users have no idea that we're requesting posts from January 4, 1999.
To more clearly convey what the URL is trying to accomplish it would be easier to display the URL as something like "\url{http://www.weblog.net/posts/day/Jan/4/1999}".
This url is much more readable to the casual passers by; it becomes obvious that we're trying to get posts from a certain day, month, and year.
Unfortunately there is a disconnect between what we would like the user to see and what is useful to us as developers.
URL rewriting provides us with a simple parser that takes in the URL that is sent to the webserver and parses and converts it to the URL that is more useful to the developer.
Fortunately for everyone, this all happens transparently without the user having to know about it.
Apache also provides the developers with an easy mechanism for implementing this functionality.
Mod_rewrite in specific provides the features that we require. 
For environments that do not have Apache and Mod_rewrite, users are in an unforuntate position.
Our team can do our best to provide users with other ways of providing the URL rewriting functionality, but these options are configured by the server administrator more so than the user.
With Apache and mod_rewrite, the rules for URL rewriting are specified in an htaccess file that the user can upload.
But with rewriting solutions such as ASAPI rewrite things aren't so easy, the user has to have access to the server configuration or a close relationship with the administrator.
We expect these situations to be rare and believe that through helpful documentation we can extend these features to other users.

\section{BitTorrent}
The past 10 years have led to a revolution in the way people use computers.
Prices of electronics have dropped drastically; increasing the number of people who can afford to use some of these powerful technologies.
This same price drop in material goods has also forced the cost of services down.
Now with high-speed internet access becoming broadly available it makes it easy for end users to create, edit, and distribute their content.
The one thing that emerges as a consistently high cost of content distribution on the web is bandwidth.
While some small users can afford to support a meager viewer-base with a small amount of funding, a larger viewership is usually reserved for those who are well funded.
Fortunately, Bram Cohen cleverly engineered the BitTorrent protocol to address such a problem.
 
As has been outlined earlier, BitTorrent is a technology that can easily enable end users to distribute content at a low cost.
This is extremely important for Broadcast Machine to support, as this technology 

Add technical information about BitTorrent:
- How it finds peers.
- How it distributes the files.
- File integrity handling.
